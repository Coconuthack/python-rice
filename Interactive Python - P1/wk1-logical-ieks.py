# Logic and Comparisons
# Boolean Expressions
# - The constants True and False of the type bool.
# - These constants can be combined to form Boolean expressions via the logical operators and, or, and not.
# - The and of two Boolean expressions is True if both of the expressions are True.
# - The or of two Boolean expressions is True if at least one of the expressions is True.

# Booleans are a value that can either be 'True' or 'False'.

# Conditional Statements â€” Conditionals

# Conditional statements are compound statements consisting one or more clauses
#   headed by the keywords if, elif, and else.
# Each if or elif clause is followed by a Boolean expression and a colon :.
# If the Boolean expression for a clause is True, the body of the clause is executed.

# Logic and Comparisons
# if-elif-else


# You can control which statements of your program execute
#	using if, elif, and else statements. They consist of the
#	keywords if, elif (else-if), or else, a boolean or boolean
#	expression (for if and elif), a colon, and then some
#	code in the body

# Change the values of the following variables to see how they
#	affect which statements are printed.

# An 'if' statement can be followed by any number of 'elif'
#	statements, followed by 0 or 1 'else' statement. 'if'
#	statements can also be followed by other 'if' statements

# Logic and Comparisons
# Examples


# Utilizing if-elif-else statements greatly expands the types
#	of functions you can make. Note that the test cases try
#	to test all of the different possibilities.
