# More Operations

# Remainder and Modular Arithmetic
# - Standard long division yields a quotient and a remainder.
# - The integer division operator // computes the quotient.
# - The operator % computes the remainder.
# - For any integers a and b, a == b * (a // b) + (a % b).
# - In Python, a % b always returns an answer that is between 0 and b (even if a and/or b is negative).
# - Remainders and modular arithmetic are very useful in games for the purpose
# - of "wrapping" the canvas,
# - i.e; causing objects that pass off of one side of the canvas to reappear on
# - the opposite side of the canvas.
